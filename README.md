# FORK NOTE

This fork is a user of my (tartpvule) proof-of-concept [Bug1424176_poc_esr78.patch](https://github.com/tartpvule/my-firefox-patches).
Meant to be a workaround for [Bug 1424176](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1424176): "document_start" hook on child frames should fire before control is returned to the parent frame`.

See [issue 17](https://github.com/airtower-luna/referer-mod/issues/17#issuecomment-843507333).

Proof-of-concept. Hacky. Comments appreciated.

# referer-mod

Referer Modifier is a Web Extension for Firefox to modify the Referer header in HTTP requests, and the Javascript `document.referrer` property to match. For each target domain, one of five actions can be configured:

* Keep: Do not modify the Referer
* Prune: Send only the origin part of the Referer (scheme, host, and port)
* Target: Send the origin of the target URL (scheme, host, and port) as Referer
* Remove: Send no Referer at all
* Replace: Replace the Referer with a configured value

You can configure default actions for requests originating from the same domain, and any other request not matching a domain rule. The "replace" and "target" actions will create a Referer header if necessary, the others only modify or remove existing ones. The configuration can be exported as and imported from JSON files.

## Installation

Users should install the add-on from the [addons.mozilla.org page](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/referer-modifier/).

If you're working on the code you can load your work in progress as a temporary add-on using the Firefox `about:debugging` page.

## Developer information

The following files implement the core functionality:

* [**engine.js**](./engine.js) defines the functions used to determine
  if and how the referrer values should be modified. This code is
  shared by background and content scripts.

* [**background.js**](./background.js) does initialization and
  contains the handler function `modifyReferer(e)` to modify
  headers. The handler function is called from an asynchronous
  [`webRequest.onBeforeSendHeaders`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/webRequest/onBeforeSendHeaders)
  event listener. `background.js` also uses event listeners to update
  the internal configuration if it is changed via the settings page.
  A dynamic content script containing the configuration is added to
  sites, for use by `content.js`.

* [**options.html**](./options.html) is the settings page. The `value`
  attributes of the `option` elements inside the `select` elements
  with `class="action"` must match the cases handled in the
  `modifyReferer(e)` function.

* [**options.js**](./options.js) handles loading and saving the
  settings from the settings page.

* [**content.js**](./content.js) is a content script that modifies the
  `document.referrer` property to match the HTTP Referer header.

Settings are saved in the [`browser.storage.sync` storage area](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/storage/sync), so if the user is using Firefox sync their settings will be synchronized automatically, otherwise the storage is local.

There is limited localization data in the [`_locales/`](./_locales/) directory. The [`Makefile`](./Makefile) serves to build a ZIP archive for upload to AMO.

The repository contains a [configuration file](./.eslintrc.yaml) for
[ESLint](https://eslint.org/). ESLint runs in CI (see the ["Referer
Mod / lint" job](.github/workflows/selenium.yaml)), please pay
attention to its results when working on a pull request.

## Testing

The [`testserver/`](./testserver/) directory of this repository
contains a test environment based on Go and Docker that you can use
locally. You can use it manually (see the
[README](./testserver/README.md)), or run [`test.py`](./test.py) for
automated tests. The automated tests require the [Selenium Python
client](https://www.selenium.dev/selenium/docs/api/py/) and
[Geckodriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver).
